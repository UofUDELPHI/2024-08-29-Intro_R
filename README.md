# 2024-08-29 Introduction to R for Data Analysis workshop

The workshop website can be 
found here: https://uofudelphi.github.io/2024-08-29-Intro_R/

If you created a new repository, you need to set Settings > Pages > Branch settings to 'main' and '/docs/' to trigger a deployment when modifications are made on the main branch.

To make changes to the website, you can then make changes in the **main branch**, render your changes in your local version, and then push the changes to GitHub. The website should automatically update within a few minutes. 

For help publishing using GitHub pages with Quarto see: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html
